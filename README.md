LunchUP
=======

This tool aims to take a large-ish population of people, and divide them into small groups for lunch.

The main goal is to develop a method to divide the large group into small groups which are also diverse.  Each person will have a set of attributes attached to them, and the tool will look at the attributes, and also past small groups, to come up with a set of groups which is diverse and ever changing.


## Future Plans

### Web interface
Initially this will just be a command line tool that is run manually.  Eventually I would like to add a customer interface for the participants to be able to register and update their preferences.

### Scheduling and Calendar Invites
Figuring out some way to pick a date for each group would be nice, as well as create iCal events and email them to each participant each month.

### Location Recommendations
Since our group seems to never be able to agree on _where_ to go, an additional aspect of this project could be having a set of lunch locations, and recommending a lunch location for the group that again tries to take into account where they've all been recently.
